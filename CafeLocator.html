            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Crema is tailored to students who seek studying-conducive cafes. Overcrowded, lack of 
                seating, cramped tables, lack of outlets, sticky tables? Avoid all of that with Cremaâ€™s 
                filters and capacity calculator. We aim to help students find the best cafe for their 
                studying needs.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Students study at a variety of places including home, the library, and cafes. At times 
                students will travel to a cafe to study only to find that there are no spots or the tables 
                aren't big enough for all of their study materials. Then they have to leave and take their 
                chances elsewhere, possibly meeting the same fate.

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                In order to preserve the precious time they have, my team beanleaf decided to create 
                Crema, a cafe-finder application that predicts the probability of securing a seat and 
                provides live occupancy ratings. Crema also features a filter system tailored for finding 
                study-conducive conditions such as quiet environment, available outlets, and large tables.

            <p>
                Each member took on an existing software application or feature that potentially addresses 
                our problem statement. We evaluated each for its intended use, user reception, and 
                possession of key features we brainstormed.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                In our research, we created a "User Interview Guide" that each of our members would follow. 
                We outlined goals and objectives, methods, scripts, questions, etc. Doing so ensures that 
                each member understands the purpose of the interview and key information we need. Each of us 
                recruited a member of the target user base and interviewed them. From our findings, we 
                noticed that the top voted dislike for studying at cafes was "limited seating". Our 
                problem statement aligned with the research findings, and allowed us to focus on addressing 
                that particular problem in our design. We decided that a prediction informing our users the 
                probability of securing a seat would be helpful. We decided we would include such a feature 
                in our lo-fi wireframes.

            <p>
                My team and I understood that personality and values shape an individual's needs and 
                concerns. We created personas to gauge those potential needs and concerns regarding 
                cafe-location.

            <h2>Design Workshop</h2>
            <p>
                My team and I planned and carried out a design workshop. During which, we each created a 
                "How might we" as shown in the image below. We also went over collected research such as 
                surveys and interview responses. Additionally, we completed an affinity map and drafted our 
                lo-fi wireframes.
                During the design workshop, our project manager, Chessah, delegated some of our members to 
                review interview responses and others to review the survey responses. I was a part of the 
                latter group. We took notes on takeaways from each response on a sticky note and put them 
                on the whiteboard. Gradually, natural groupings started to appear, so we clustered related 
                notes together and labeled them. We noticed a lot of emphasis on preferences; it had the 
                most sticky notes and many expressed liking it. 
                Most of the problems that responses had with study at cafes pertained to seat acquisition 
                at nearby cafes. As a result, we focused on including a filter system and sorting cafe 
                results by current location in our wireframes.

            <h2>Sketches and Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                During our design workshop, I created a sketch for the search results screen and map. 
                From that sketch, I created a wireframe to detail the features and layout of information, 
                prioritizing convenience and readability.
