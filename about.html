        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-me">
            <p>
                My name is Leslie Lei, and I love learning about usability and accessibility to create easy-to-use 
                websites and apps. I am deeply interested about self-growth and improvement, and I actively look 
                for ways to improve.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have a degree in Informatics or Information Science from the University of California, Irvine. 
                As a student, I have learned about usability, accessibility, and design in my classes. As a team member and 
                leader of project groups, I have learned about planning, communication, compassion, and flexibility. I strive to 
                bring these qualities and knowledge to the projects that I work on.

        <h2>My Values</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>
                I believe that there is always something to be learned. Whether it be playing a sport or designing software, I realized that there 
                were many factors that contribute to success. Acquiring knowledge gets us closer to that 
                success. That is why after finishing my formal education, I continue to learn from online 
                classes and from attending hackathons.
            </p>
            <h3>Compassion</h3>
            <p>
                I value compassion because I know what it is like to have tough days. And in those cases, 
                giving compassion to myself did not make me weak or lazy. It gave me the strength to 
                continue on with what I needed to do. Compassion teaches oneself that you are deserving of 
                it and that you are more than what you struggle with.
            </p>
            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>
                I value communication because I have learned from projects that I have worked on the 
                importance of communication, responsiveness, and being on the same page with team mates. 
                When working with others towards a common goal, it is important to convey ideas clearly 
                and effectively to foster mutual understanding.
            </p>
            <h3>Passion</h3>
            <p>
                I believe that passion is important because it is motivation and drive. To me, passion 
                comes from feeling that your work is meaningful and has a real, positive impact on people. 
                Feeling like my work is meaningful and real helps me feel excited, work hard toward my 
                goals, and persevere through obstacles.
