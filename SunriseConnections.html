                with each other. Accessible features include ADA compliant color scheme, large text,

                <p class="problem-title">
                    Nearly 25% of adults aged 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated. Older adults 
                    are more likely to have experienced the death of a loved one and are also more likely to live 
                    by themselves. oftentimes resulting in feelings of loneliness. <br>The stress of loneliness can 
                    compound mental and physical health problems like depression and stroke. Loneliness can also 
                    increase oneâ€™s vulnerability to theft, exploitation, and abuse.

                <p class="challenge-title">
                    My team was tasked with creating a technology-based solution to increased loneliness observed 
                    in individuals aged 60 and older. Our solution had to not only accommodate needs specific to 
                    this age group, but also encourage social interaction amongst its users.

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>
                    We surveyed 19 individuals from our target population to understand their needs, pain points, 
                    and their use of technology. We had to figure out why despite widespread access to a smartphone 
                    and the numerous social networking apps for download, a majority of our participants still 
                    reported difficulties with contacting others. Additionally, the widespread access to a 
                    smartphone was something we could utilize in creating a mobile application.

            <h3>White Paper Research</h3>
            <p>
                We did additional research on design principles for older individuals and those experiencing 
                loneliness. Principles included using big buttons, appropriate font size, readable contrast, 
                and an inviting color scheme.

            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>
                We created personas to understand how different lifestyles and values influence the way users 
                might use technology.

            <p>
                My team and I created a storyboard of a potential user to explore different ways our app might 
                be used, therefore, what functionalities we might want to include.

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted competitive analysis to compare existing solutions/assess their individual pros 
                and cons as a part of our features ideation. Based on our user research, Facebook, Reddit, and 
                AARP are common platforms or resources frequented by seniors. We compared them based on their 
                Homepage, Navigation, Usability, and Aesthetic.

            <p>
                Sketches and wireframes were created to visualize formatting for the various pages of our 
                app at low stakes. After the team and I each drafted sketches of the app, we created a 
                wireframe combining the most favored elements of each sketch.

            <h2>Stakeholder Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                My team and I held bi-weekly meetings with our stakeholders at Tata Consultancy Services. We 
                incorporated their feedback into our design.
            </p>
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>After creating our wireframes, we moved onto one-on-one testing sessions over Zoom. During the 
                testing we asked our participants to perform a series of tasks and comment on the features as 
                well as the design in regards to color scheme, readability, and navigability.
