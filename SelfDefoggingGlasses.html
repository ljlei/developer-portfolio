            <p>This one is for the glasses wearers. Achieve a clear view with ClearView self-defogging 
                glasses. No more manual wiping, reapplying sprays or dish soap, or using wipes that 
                leave a streaky view. Our glasses allow you to defog your glasses at the click of a button.

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>For glasses wearers, the issue of fogging of the lens has always been an issue. However, 
                    with the emergence of COVID-19 and widespread mask-use, the issue has increased. Glasses 
                    fogging is very inconvenient for the wearer and even dangerous. With a mask, it can occur 
                    any time one’s relatively warmer breath hits the colder surface of their glasses lens and  
                    anywhere such as when one is talking or breathing heavily. This can be dangerous if one is 
                    crossing the street, running, or driving. Glasses fogging can also occur when one is not 
                    wearing a mask such as when eating hot food or drinking hot drink, moving from the cool 
                    outdoors to a warm building, or taking food out of the oven.

            <span class="case-study-card">
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    After conducting competitive analysis, my team and I found that current solutions to glasses 
                    fogging include a piece of cloth, dish soap, Anti-Fog sprays and wipes, and Anti-Fog safety 
                    glasses.
                    The method of cloth is inconvenient as it requires the wearer to remove their glasses and 
                    manually wipe the glasses every time fog accumulates. Dish soap can create an uneven coating 
                    of the glasses, leaving some areas vulnerable to fogging. Anti-fog sprays and wipes create a 
                    coating that prevents fogging, however they have issues of transience, streakiness and 
                    unevenness, and odor. 
                    We had to create a solution that minimized or eliminated the cons and incorporated the pros 
                    of each solution.                              
                </p>
            </span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="case-study-card">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                My team and I researched an existing defogging mechanism—car defrosting. We found that 
                there are different methods for defrosting the front window and the rear window. Defrosting 
                the front window requires blasting warm air. My team and I felt that blowing air would be 
                uncomfortable for the glasses wearer, so we investigated further. Defrosting the rear 
                window, on the other hand, utilizes heating rods to warm the glass. We felt that this would 
                be more comfortable for the wearer, however, the placement of the rods to sufficiently warm 
                the glass would also obstruct the wearer’s view. My team and I decided our smart glasses 
                would blow warm air onto the glass to defog itself. However, we decided to have the air blow 
                from the outside of the glass to avoid discomfort to the wearer.

            <h2>Sketches and Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                I created a sketch demonstrating what causes fog to form on glasses and how a companion 
                app would look like or help with the fogging. As a team, we brainstormed how the defogging 
                mechanism would work. The second and third sketches illustrate our ideas of regulating 
                glasses temperature with air.

                <h3>The Smart Glasses</h3>
                <p>
                    The components of the smart glasses include lens made from the standard CR-39 
                    (Columbia Resin) Plastic Formula for a lightweight, and scratch-resistant lens. 
                    They will also be coated with the standard anti-scratch and anti-glare formulas. 
                    Our frames will be from carbon fiber compared to the standard Titanium or Plastic ones. 
                    Carbon Fiber provides a lighter weight, stronger build, and more corrosion resistance 
                    although it is more expensive. Bluetooth chip for location feature. Led lights for 
                    locating assistance. Charging will be through a USB-C charging port. Plastic 5 volt 
                    fans on the outside of the glasses for temperature regulation of the lens and to avoid 
                    discomfort of the eye. Lithium ion batteries to power the device. An on/off power 
                    switch. A Qualcomm Wearable 2500 platform chip for a quality chip, while not being 
                    overly complex and expensive, to run the glasses and connect to software.
