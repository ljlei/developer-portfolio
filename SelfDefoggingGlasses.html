            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This one is for the glasses wearers. Achieve a clear view with ClearView self-defogging 
                glasses. No more manual wiping, reapplying sprays or dish soap, or using wipes that 
                leave a streaky view. Our glasses allow you to defog your glasses at the click of a button.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>For glasses wearers, the issue of fogging of the lens has always been an issue. However, 
                with the emergence of COVID-19 and widespread mask-use, the issue has increased. Glasses 
                fogging is very inconvenient for the wearer and even dangerous. With a mask, it can occur 
                any time oneâ€™s relatively warmer breath hits the colder surface of their glasses lens and  
                anywhere such as when one is talking or breathing heavily. This can be dangerous if one is 
                crossing the street, running, or driving. Glasses fogging can also occur when one is not 
                wearing a mask such as when eating hot food or drinking hot drink, moving from the cool 
                outdoors to a warm building, or taking food out of the oven.                
            </p>

        <div class="case-study-card">
            <h2>The Challenge and Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                After conducting competitive analysis, my team and I found that current solutions to glasses 
                fogging include a piece of cloth, dish soap, Anti-Fog sprays and wipes, and Anti-Fog safety 
                glasses.
                The method of cloth is inconvenient as it requires the wearer to remove their glasses and 
                manually wipe the glasses every time fog accumulates. Dish soap can create an uneven coating 
                of the glasses, leaving some areas vulnerable to fogging. Anti-fog sprays and wipes create a 
                coating that prevents fogging, however they have issues of transience, streakiness and 
                unevenness, and odor. 
                We had to create a solution that minimized or eliminated the cons and incorporated the pros 
                of each solution.

            <p>
                I created a sketch demonstrating what causes fog to form on glasses and how a companion 
                app would look like or help with the fogging. As a team, we brainstormed how the defogging 
                mechanism would work. The second and third sketches illustrate our ideas of regulating 
                glasses temperature with air.

                <h2>The Smart Glasses</h2>
                <p>
                    The components of the smart glasses include lens made from the standard CR-39 
                    (Columbia Resin) Plastic Formula for a lightweight, and scratch-resistant lens. 
                    They will also be coated with the standard anti-scratch and anti-glare formulas. 
                    Our frames will be from carbon fiber compared to the standard Titanium or Plastic ones. 
                    Carbon Fiber provides a lighter weight, stronger build, and more corrosion resistance 
                    although it is more expensive. Bluetooth chip for location feature. Led lights for 
                    locating assistance. Charging will be through a USB-C charging port. Plastic 5 volt 
                    fans on the outside of the glasses for temperature regulation of the lens and to avoid 
                    discomfort of the eye. Lithium ion batteries to power the device. An on/off power 
                    switch. A Qualcomm Wearable 2500 platform chip for a quality chip, while not being 
                    overly complex and expensive, to run the glasses and connect to software.
